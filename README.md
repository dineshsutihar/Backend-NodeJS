# NPM Scripts
- NPM scripts are defined in the `package.json` file.
- They are used to automate tasks like testing, building, and deployment.
- They are defined under the `scripts` property in the `package.json` file.
- They can be executed using the `npm run <script-name>` command.

## Example
```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  }
}
```


# Middleware 
- Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
- Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
  - Execute any code.
  - Make changes to the request and the response objects.
  - End the request-response cycle.
  - Call the next middleware function in the stack.

## Types of Middleware
1. Application-level Middleware
2. Router-level Middleware
3. Error-handling Middleware
4. Built-in Middleware
5. Third-party Middleware

## Example
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Application-level Middleware
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Time:', Date.now());
  next();
});
```


# Form Handling and working with Forms
- Form handling is a common requirement in web applications.
- Forms are used to collect user input.
- In Node.js applications, we can handle form data using the `body-parser` middleware.
- we already have multiple packages available to handle form data in Node.js applications.
- eg: `body-parser`, `multer`, `formidable`, etc.

## Session & Cookies
- Sessions and cookies are used to store user-specific data.
- Sessions are stored on the server, and cookies are stored on the client-side.

- Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored in the client's browser.
- They are sent to the server with every request.

#### Use this befor any route so that we can handle form data
```javascript
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
app.use(express.json());
```

### Use Prettier from NPM
 -  it is a dev dependency and we should install it as a dev dependency because if we are working in a team then everyone should have the same code style.

 ```bash
 npm i -D prettier
 ```
